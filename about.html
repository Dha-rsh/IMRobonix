        <h2> Pioneers in Precision Medical Robotics</h2>
        <p>As the saying goes “Every life matters”, and “ There is no greater wealth in this world than good health”,
          Life of each and every individual is an asset for their family and to the country.
          People rush towards doctors to save the life of their dear ones in case of any health issues.
          Rapid development in medical robotics is a great relive to both the patients and the Doctors.
          However statistical record says that 1 in every 112,000 surgical procedures leads to an error which may even
          lead to life threatening consequences.
          In light of such a serious impediment in Health sector, ImRobonix was established by Mr. Iyyappan and other
          co-founders on 2021 to revolutionize Medical Robotics and embrace the healthcare world in a more sustainable
          way by inventing cost efficient and high precision medical Robots.

      <p>
        Dr. Palani, a famous surgeon from Tamil Nadu,
        India drew to our attention a real-world problem that served
        as the fuel to our innovation. He learned that the current minimally invasive
        surgical device, both manual and Robotic system ,is rather difficult to use and operate.
        He presented all the practical difficulties to the company's founder,
        Mr. Iyyappan. After the rigorous analysis and detailed discussion with the experts,
        Mr. Iyyappan along with his team was able to create and produce a multipurpose,
        high-precision, bio-medical device. A team constituting people across the Globe were
        handpicked to address the aforementioned problem after assessing the technical
        difficulties in a manually controllable MIS tool and high cost robotic systems.
        Our product aims to be the first robotic surgical tool controlled by the thumb that
        has characteristics similar to the human hand.

      <p>
        Continuous learning is essential for success in any field. The relentless efforts of ordinary individuals have
        led to today’s advanced, tech-driven world. Electrical and electronic innovations are in a constant race,
        turning the impossible into reality. Now, artificial intelligence is shaping the future, transforming life into
        a dreamlike experience. Our team developed Surgi-Kot to ease complex surgeries by converting unrestricted hand
        gestures into precise laparoscopic maneuvers. Imrobonix's electrical crew played a crucial role in this
        innovation. We, as dedicated young minds, meticulously followed a roadmap to ensure its success.

        <h2>Revolutionary Thumb-Controlled Surgical Robot</h2>
        <p>
          Surgi-Kot, our revolutionary surgical robot, is the world's first thumb-controlled device. Designed to enhance
          surgical precision, it operates via a joystick-like thumb control, offering high accuracy and flexibility. Our
          team dedicated months to this project, aiming to reduce surgical errors and improve outcomes. Surgi-Kot’s
          innovative design decreases surgeon difficulty and minimizes post-surgery complications, making it a
          groundbreaking advancement in robotic surgery. We’re proud to introduce this cutting-edge technology for a
          more successful surgical experience.
